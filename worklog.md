More work on the town tileset. This is going to take a while.

# 9/24/20
Upgraded to GB Studio 2 Beta 2
Started learning Aseprite. Started on the town tileset and exported it as a sample background to see how it would look.

# 9/15/20
Watched some art tutorials as my pixel art skills are.... lacking to say the least.
Bought and downloaded Aseprite - the text entry alone should save me a ton of time.

Created credits scene and figured out a way to make it scroll.
Tried to get a credits option on the start menu, proved more difficult than expected. I did find a community plugin called 'no limit menu' that would work, but I'm going to wait for now.
Got the cursor to move on the main menu as expected.
Save game functionality added. Ran into an issue with continuing.

# 9/11/20
Created a new cursor sprite, removing the default.
Tweaked the menu a bit.
Figured out why my menu select sprite wasn't animating - needed to make it static.

# 9/10/20
Updated logo and title screens. Still not done, but can be revisited later.
Created new menu and added to game. Still not fully functional.
Cleaned up unneeded background assets from the sample project.
