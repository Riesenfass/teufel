Created credits scene and figured out a way to make it scroll.
Tried to get a credits option on the start menu, proved more difficult than expected. I did find a community plugin called 'no limit menu' that would work, but I'm going to wait for now.

Created a new cursor sprite, removing the default.
Tweaked the menu a bit.
Figured out why my menu select sprite wasn't animating - needed to make it static.

Updated logo and title screens. Still not done, but can be revisited later.
Created new menu and added to game. Still not fully functional.
Cleaned up unneeded background assets from the sample project.
